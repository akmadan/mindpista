THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES:
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques
- Mindfulness and present-moment awareness
- Solution-focused brief therapy
- Positive psychology principles
- Stress management strategies
- Emotional regulation techniques

CONVERSATION STYLE:
- Ask open-ended questions to encourage exploration
